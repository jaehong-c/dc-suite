        <Section eyebrow="What it does">
          <Para first>
            DC Risk Register takes a 22-field project profile and evaluates it against a curated
            library of 72 development and operating risks. Each risk is scored deterministically by
            trigger rules, plotted on a 5x5 heat matrix, and summarized in an AI-generated leadership
            memo. It is the second tool in a suite that follows a project from site selection
            (Site Screener) through lease economics (Lease Comparator) into lifecycle risk.
          </Para>
        </Section>

        <Section eyebrow="Methodology">
          <Para first>
            The register follows the ISO 31000 sequence: identify, analyze, evaluate, treat. Every
            risk carries a likelihood (1 to 5) and impact (1 to 5); score equals L times I. Bands are
            Low (1 to 4), Medium (5 to 9), High (10 to 15), and Critical (16 to 25). The project-level
            verdict is Contained, Moderate, or Elevated, driven by the count and concentration of
            High and Critical risks in the current phase.
          </Para>
          <Para>
            Trigger rules read the profile fields directly. A 500 MW campus in permitting with no
            executed interconnection agreement, for example, raises PWR likelihood; a signed
            pre-lease lowers FIN impact. Any field left as unknown marks dependent risks as
            unverified and lists them in the Data gaps panel rather than silently assuming a value.
          </Para>

        <Section eyebrow="Reviewer controls">
          <Para first>
            Rule-based scores can be overridden per risk with a reason. Every override, revert, and
            clear is written to an audit log with reviewer name and timestamp, and the log is
            appended to the CSV export so the register remains traceable back to the rule baseline.

        <Section eyebrow="Data sources and limits">
          <Para first>
            The risk library and state-level ratings were curated by the author for this prototype.
            They are not sourced from proprietary company data and have not been validated against
            historical project outcomes. Three presets (West Texas early-stage, Northern Virginia
            under construction, Ohio operating) serve as calibration checks for the rule engine.
            Treat scores as a structured starting point for review, not a substitute for
            project-specific assessment.
          </Para>
        </Section>

        <Section eyebrow="How it was built">
          <Para first>
            Next.js 16 App Router, JavaScript, Tailwind v4, static JSON data layer, and a server
            route that calls the Anthropic API for the memo. Architecture and rule logic were
            scoped in conversation with Claude, files were generated and then assembled in Cursor,
            and the app is deployed on Vercel.
